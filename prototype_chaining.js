// Simple prototype chain example

var myFriends = {name: "Pete"};
​
​// To find the name property below, the search will begin directly on the myFriends object and will immediately find the name property because we defined the property name on the myFriend object. This could be thought of as a prototype chain with one link.​
console.log(myFriends.name);
​
​// In this example, the search for the toString () method will also begin on the myFriends’ object, but because we never created a toString method on the myFriends object, the compiler will then search for it on the myFriends prototype (the object which it inherited its properties from).​
​
​// And since all objects created with the object literal inherits from Object.prototype, the toString method will be found on Object.prototype—see important note below for all properties inherited from Object.prototype. ​
​
myFriends.toString ();

// ---------------
// Another example

function People () {
​this.superstar = "Michael Jackson";
}
​// Define "athlete" property on the People prototype so that "athlete" is accessible by all objects that use the People () constructor.​
People.prototype.athlete = "Tiger Woods";
​
​var famousPerson = new People ();
famousPerson.superstar = "Steve Jobs";
​
​// The search for superstar will first look for the superstar property on the famousPerson object, and since we defined it there, that is the property that will be used. Because we have overwritten the famousPerson’s superstar property with one directly on the famousPerson object, the search will NOT proceed up the prototype chain. ​
console.log (famousPerson.superstar); // Steve Jobs​
​
​// Note that in ECMAScript 5 you can set a property to read only, and in that case you cannot overwrite it as we just did.​
​
​// This will show the property from the famousPerson prototype (People.prototype), since the athlete property was not defined on the famousPerson object itself.​
console.log (famousPerson.athlete); // Tiger Woods​
​
​// In this example, the search proceeds up the prototype chain and find the toString method on Object.prototype, from which the Fruit object inherited—all objects ultimately inherits from Object.prototype as we have noted before.​
console.log (famousPerson.toString()); // [object Object]
