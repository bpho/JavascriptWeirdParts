Section 7: Odds and Ends
========================

-------------------
Initialization - H1
-------------------
Check code.
--> Great way to utilize creating objects with a lot of properties, objects, and areas to imititate database data if you're connected to a backend yet. Notation can be overwhelming at times but get used to it.
	1. Object Notation with properties
	2. Array notation
	3. Function notations
	--> These can all reside in an object
- Remember comments between properties and elements in an array
- Remember you're using colons (:) not equal signs


-----------------------------------------------------------
'typeof', 'instanceof', and Figuring out what something is - H2
-----------------------------------------------------------
Not camelcased to not be confused with functions
- 'typeof'
	- Tells us what type of thing something is
	var a = 3
	console.log(typeof a); --> outputs number, "3" would return a string
- 'instanceof'
	- If any objects down the prototype chain match the 'instanceof' object it's being compared with
	var e = new Person();
	console.log(e instanceof Person); // true


-------------
Strict Mode - H3
-------------
"use strict";
- At the top of your script, use stricter rules in your code
- Or goes at the top of a function (within it)
- Doesn't allow a variable to be used unless you declare it
- If you concatenate javascript files when they're pushed into production. If it exists on the very top of the first file, it'll be implemented in the rest of the files
person = {}; // not allowed
var person = {}; // allowed
